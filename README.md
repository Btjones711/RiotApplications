# RiotApplications
Project for creating applications with Riot API. Made because of my interest in league and wanting to develop applications using the API for player use. Join if you play LOL or just want to have fun creating! 

# Contributing
To help contributing head over to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and get a API key. After that place it in a file, you have to create, called API_KEY.py.
Once this is done set it up like API_key = "RGAPI-#########"

def getAPI_KEY():
    return API_key
    
And it should work with my intial API retrieval library RiotAPI.py.

#So Far
At the moment I am currently building up the tools to be able to start creating amazing applications. If there are any API retrievals that I have not added and you think they should be there add them. If you think you can create something with what we have start it.
Make sure that everyone knows what you are working on so we can help and so there is no overlap of ideas.

#Ideas
If you have any ideas add them to an issue so we can work together and discuss it.

#That is all for now
